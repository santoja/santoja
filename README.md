# Hi there! 👋 I'm Kaue Santoja

### About Me
Since 2006, I've been immersed in the tech world, primarily dancing through the realms of React, PHP, and GoLang.

### What Fires Me Up 🔥
Challenges are my fuel, and exploring new technologies is my jam.

### Current Role 🚀
I've been donning the Senior Engineer hat lately, diving deep into React, PHP, and enjoying the twists and turns of GoLang.

### Lessons Learned 🌟
One memorable lesson from my past roles: always double-check every facet of a project. Even a specialist can trip up (yep, even yours truly!).

### Education 📚
I pursued a technical high school diploma and later graduated with a degree in "Tecnologia em Software Livre" (Translation: Technology in Free Software). Embracing open-source principles was a cornerstone of my education.

### Influential Encounters 🌍
I had the incredible opportunity to be part of the inaugural Open Source Week in Americana, where I rubbed shoulders with luminaries in the open-source community, including the maintainer of Slackware Linux.

### Beyond Tech 🎮🎶
When I unplug, you'll find me in the virtual realms of video games or belting out tunes. I'm also a PC building aficionado and have a soft spot for all things open-source.

### Let's Connect! 🌐
I'm always up for a chat! Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/santoja/) and let's share thoughts on the latest tech trends or discuss the best RPGs out there.

### Fun Fact 🎉
If I'm not in front of a screen, I'm probably jamming to some tunes or diving into the intricacies of hardware to build the ultimate PC setup.
